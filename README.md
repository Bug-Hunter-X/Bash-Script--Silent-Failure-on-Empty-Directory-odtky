This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a bash script that processes files in a directory. The script fails silently if the directory is empty because the find command does not return any file names, resulting in the while loop not executing. The solution provided addresses this by checking if find returns any files before proceeding with the file processing.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling, even in seemingly simple scripts.
